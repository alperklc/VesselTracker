# VesselTracker

Vessel tracking Nodejs web application. Wrote this pile of code in order to track my intern seaman brother.
This application is GETting once in 15 minutes from Marinetraffic.com, scrapping content from web page, storing the recent data on MongoDB, emitting the fresh data to the clients by socket.js and drawing lines on the map. 

Working site is available on: geminerede-alperdev.rhcloud.com
